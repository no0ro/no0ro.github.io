Working through this first project was tough in the beginning, but once I got rolling it was pretty fun and great practice.

The beginning was tough for two reasons. First, I found it hard to decide on a topic that met the project requirement, had a beginner friendly API, and was something that I am actually interested in. I just kept mentally twirling in indecision. The good news is, the more I learn the easier this step will be because I'll better understand my capabilitiess, the scope of the challenge, and well, APIs.
Second, I found it challenging to figure out how to set up my files, environment, dependencies, etc. To connect the dots I watched some Flatiron videos, Googled around, and took very detailed notes to try and understand how and why these pieces were necessary for the puzzle.

I really enjoyed implementing my methods and writing the logic of the program. This is where I had the most fun, felt comfortable, and got into a good flow. All in all, I learned a lot and am excited to tackle Sinatra.
